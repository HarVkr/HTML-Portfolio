<h1>Harshal's Favorite Movies of all Time</h1>
<h2>Here's a list of my Favorite Comedy Bollywood Movies of all time!!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Phir Hera Pheri</h3>
<p>
    Phir Hera Pheri is the one movie which is my comfort watch. Everytime I am bored or I feel low, this is my go-to Movies
    The movie features amazing actors like Paresh Rawal as my Favorite Baburao, Akshay Kumar as Raju, Sunil Shetty as Shyam, 
    Johhny Lever as Munna Bhai and that one actor as Kachraseth, jiska real naam yaad nahi! P.S . Sorry about that
</p>
<h3>De Dana Dan</h3>
<p>
    De Dana Dan, is that movie which is literally full of Chaos! The movie is so well written and made that, whenever I sit at any 
    point of time, in the movie, I just cannot get up until it is finished! Johnny Lever's is my Favorite character in that movie!<br/>
    "Ye bolti hain isne mujhe paisa diya hain, Ye bolta hain isne mujhe paisa diya, <br/>
     aur udhar ek SAAND hain, woh boltay usne mujhe paisa diya hain!<br/>
     Aree, main kya tawaif hu joh mujhe sabne paisa diya hain!"<br/>
     Yeah Dialogues are on my tongue, so so so Favorite!<br/>

<h3>Dhamaal</h3>
<p>
    Dhamaal is entertaining every time to watch from the start till the end, the plane sequence is my Favorite though!
